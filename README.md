# Battery Data Format (.bdf)

## Why introduce an industry standard format for battery data?

It is well known that organizing, cleaning, and preparing battery data for analytics takes significant time and effort, creating a high barrier to leveraging advances in battery modeling for battery development cycles.

[A 2024 Forrester study](https://www.monolithai.com/ev-battery-validation-ai-study) surveyed 165 decision-makers in the automotive industry responsible for EV battery testing, validation, and development in the US and Europe. Among the respondents, 57% cited deciphering complex relationships in vast, multiparameter datasets as a significant barrier to battery validation, and 61% estimated months to years of time savings from AI-powered cell characterization testing that leverages standardized data sets.

## Goal of launching the BDF

The **Battery Data Format (BDF)** provides a standard structure for data generated in battery labs, offered to the community by the **Battery Data Alliance**, a Linux Foundation Energy project. It is our hope that adoption of the BDF will empower the battery science community to leverage advances in open-source battery models.

Developed with input from leading scientists and engineers, the BDF addresses two main challenges:

- **Data Consistency**: With a common format, labs and cycler brands can eliminate the inconsistencies in data structure that arise with each software update.
- **Model Compatibility**: A unified format means battery model developers can easily adapt their models to accept BDF data, making it possible for scientists to experiment with multiple models without custom coding each time.

## Initial Scope of the BDF

- The initial scope is intended to facilitate use and comparison of cycler time-series data.  
- The BDF provides a fixed table schema for time-series battery data, which is supplemented with a machine-readable application ontology for integration with the Semantic Web.  
- The BDF application ontology is defined as an extension of the BattINFO domain ontology, which provides interoperability within the broader field of battery data. 
- An immediate next step will be launching a parallel format for storing metadata for the BDF.
- Future development will focus on formats for other types of lab data such as impedance data.

## Defining the BDF for Cycler Time-Series Data

1. **Each file contains time-series data for one and only one cell.**  
   - Multiple files can be provided for the same cell.

### Self-describing data

A BDF column header is not just a text label — it is a globally unique identifier that machines can look up. Every quantity in the tables below links to a term in the [BDF application ontology](https://github.com/battery-data-alliance/battery-data-format-ontology), which resolves to its full machine-readable definition: physical meaning, canonical unit, mathematical relationship to other quantities, and conformance level (required / recommended / optional). The vocabulary extends the [BattINFO](https://github.com/BIG-MAP/BattINFO) battery domain ontology and is built on established web standards: [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/)/[OWL](https://www.w3.org/OWL/) for formal semantics, [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) for labels and vocabulary mapping, [schema.org](https://schema.org/) annotations for search-engine discoverability, [QUDT](https://qudt.org/) and UCUM for units, [PROV-O](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/) for how derived quantities are computed, and [SOSA](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/)/[CSVW](https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-data-primer/) for observations and tabular structure.

What that buys you in practice:

- **No vendor ambiguity** — "capacity" from different cyclers maps to explicitly distinct terms (charging, discharging, net, cumulative) with formal definitions.
- **Semantic web-native** — BDF files can be lifted to linked data, indexed by search engines via the schema.org annotations, and integrated with other EMMO-aligned resources.
- **Agentic & automated workflows** — software agents and LLM-based tools can resolve a column's meaning, units, and relationships at runtime, enabling automated validation, unit conversion, and cross-dataset harmonization without human interpretation.
- **No documentation drift** — the tables below, and this package's validation logic, are generated from the same ontology release (the bundled snapshot), so documentation, code, and semantics cannot disagree.

5. **Data structure**:
   - The first row contains a header row with the preferred label of the quantity in the corresponding column.
   - The units of the quantities are fixed.
   - All rows must match the initial header in column count, ensuring consistent formatting.

6. **File naming conventions**:
   - Recommended format:  
     ```
     InstitutionCode__CellName__YYYYMMDD_XXX.csv
     ```
     Example:  
     ```
     UCam__A0001__20241031_001.csv
     ```
   - Additional metadata (e.g., cell model, serial number, unique identifier) should be stored within a parallel metadata file.

7. **File extension**:
   - Files using text-based serialization can be saved with the `.bdf` extension.  
   - If another extension is necessary, it can be supplemented with a `.bdf` prefix (e.g. `example.bdf.parquet`)  
   - Stream compressors like `gzip` can be used to save space, resulting in `.bdf.gz` files.
   - It is assumed that `.bdf` files adhere to the BDF conventions, and future validator functions may be created to enforce this.

## Summary

The **Battery Data Format (.bdf)** is a step toward unifying and accelerating battery research and development. By adopting this open-source standard, we can foster collaboration, enhance model interoperability, and unlock the full potential of data-driven battery innovation.

## Install the Python Package

```bash
pip install batterydf
# Neware .nda/.ndax support is included in base
# Interactive plotting (hvplot/bokeh)
pip install batterydf[hvplot]
# Polars + fast NDA backend
pip install batterydf[polars]
# Force numpy 2.x (combine as needed, e.g. batterydf[polars,numpy2])
pip install batterydf[numpy2]
# for docs/dev: pip install -e .[dev,docs]
```

PyPI distribution name is ``batterydf``; Python import and CLI remain ``bdf``.

Optional fast NDA backend (Python >=3.10, numpy >=2.2 required):
```bash
pip install fastnda
```

bdf.plot(df_clean, xdata="Test Time / s", ydata=["Voltage / V"], save="plot.png")

# Interactive exploration (plotly included in base; bokeh requires batterydf[hvplot])
bdf.explore(df_clean, xdata="Test Time / s", ydata="Voltage / V", yydata="Current / A", backend="bokeh")
bdf.explore(df_clean, xdata="Test Time / s", ydata="Voltage / V", yydata="Current / A", backend="plotly")

# Ingest a folder of raw files into BDF artifacts
summary = bdf.ingest("data/raw", out_dir="data/bdf", format="parquet")
```

## FAQ

### Which label should I use for my column headings?

You should use the Preferred Label for your column headings. This is the label that is designed to adhere to recommendations for human-readable titles and corresponds to the `csvw:titles` property in the table schema.

### What is the difference between the preferred label and the machine-readable name?

The preferred label is designed to be readable for humans and adhere to IUPAC / SI guidelines for quantity notation. But the preferred label contains some characters (e.g. spaces and slashes) that can create difficulty for some machines. The machine-readable name is designed to be an alias for referring to the quantity in software. It is linked to the preferred label in both the BDF application ontology and the CSVW table schema.

### Why do we use a slash between the quantity and the unit?

This is the notation that is recommended by authoritative bodies like IUPAC and SI. The slash comes from the fact that quantities are the product of a value and a unit, and they obey the rules of algebra. For example, if we say that `Voltage = 4.2 V` and divide both sides of the equation by the unit, we get `Voltage / V = 4.2`

### How can I check if my file is a valid instance of BDF?

Use the built-in validator. From Python:

```python
import bdf

df = bdf.read("path/to/file.bdf.csv")
report = bdf.validate(df, report=True, raise_on_error=False)
```

Or from the command line:

```bash
bdf validate path/to/file.bdf.csv
```

The validator checks column headers and units against the BDF ontology, structural rules such as time monotonicity, and the ontology-defined relationships between derived columns (e.g. that cumulative capacity equals charging plus discharging capacity).
